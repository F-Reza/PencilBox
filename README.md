# 01 ==> Simple Dice Game

You roll two dice. Each die has six faces, which contain one, two, three, four, five and six spots, respectively. 

After the dice have come to rest, the sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated.

***If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, you win. 

***If the sum is 2, 3 or 12 on the first throw (called “craps"), you lose (i.e., the "house" wins). 

***If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 on the first throw, that sum becomes your "point." 

***To win, you must continue rolling the dice until you "make your point” (i.e., roll that same point value). 

***You lose by rolling a 7 before making your point.
